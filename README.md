## Voice Comments in IntelliJ

We all love audios from our friends on messenger apps, right? Now, you can hear them in your code, too! With **Voice Comments**, you can listen to your mate Benji yap about the function he over-engineered.

### Usage
Simply right-click on the line you want to insert your voice comment, and click on "Add Voice Note".
To play this audio, select the voice comment and click on "Play Voice Note".

### Note
This was a just for fun project, clustered together in about an hour - just because i liked the idea. Please dont take this seriously.
